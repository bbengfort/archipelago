# Archipelago

**Fabric file and environment for managing the archipelago cluster.**

## Getting Started

This repository simply hosts a simple fabric file for management commands on remote hosts in the cluster. To use it, install Fabric as follows:

```
$ pip install fabric
```

You can then run commands as follows:

```
$ fab hostname
```

And they will execute on the entire cluster.
